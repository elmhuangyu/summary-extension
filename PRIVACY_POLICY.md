**Privacy Policy for Summary Extension**

This Privacy Policy describes how Summary Extension ("the Extension") handles your information.

**1. Data Collection**
The Extension itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data. We are committed to ensuring your privacy and do not track your browsing activity, personal information, or any other data directly through the Extension.

Therefore, the data handling practices, privacy policies, and security measures of the LLM service you choose are entirely independent of this Extension.

We strongly advise you to review the privacy policy and terms of service of any LLM service you choose to use with this Extension to understand how they collect, use, store, and protect your data. You are solely responsible for your interactions with and the data you share with these third-party services.
